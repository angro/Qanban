QANBAN - README

Information for developing on the Qanban application - basic instructions to get started.


1. Make sure you have Groovy and Grails installed on your computer. (http://groovy.codehaus.org/ and http://grails.org/)
   This build currently use Groovy v 1.6.5 and Grails v 1.1.1
2. Setup MySQL with a database called "qanban", and a user: qanban, with password: qanban. If you wish to change this you
   can edit the DataSource.groovy in the grails-app/conf folder.
3. With git installed, "git init" and "git clone git://github.com/qbranchcode/Qanban.git" in your prefered folder.

Good to know
By default the application will create 2 users, testadmin and testuser (password and username is the same).

Now you should be ready to start develop!
